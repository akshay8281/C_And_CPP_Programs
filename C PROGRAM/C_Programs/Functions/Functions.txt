Functions:-Function is a block of code or a piece of code that we can use
again and again.

With the help of function we can reuse the same code by calling the function
again and again

Function Provides reusability because we can call same function as many
times as we want.

Types of Function:-

1) Inbuilt Function or Library Functions:-printf(),scanf(),main(),strlen()...

2) User Defined Functions:- Which is defined by user:-
add(),greetings(),factorial()...


Function Declaration:- We will declare the function

Function Calling:- We will call the function

syntax:-

	datatype functionname(int a, int b)   -- Function Declaration
	{
		block of code...

	}
	main()
	{

		functionname(10,20);  -- Function calling

	}



void-null value

a=20
b=30

a=30
b=20


a=10
b=20

swapping
a=20
b=10


a=a+b
a=30

b=a-b
 =20-10
b=10

a=a-b
 =30-10
a=20


Categories of Function:-

There are 4 categories of Functions:-

1) Function Without Parameters and Without Return Value

2) Function With Parameters and Without Return Value

3) Function Without Parameters and With Return Value

4) Function With Parameters and With Return Value


Interview Question:- Difference Between Parameters and Arguments.

Parameters:-The variables which we will write during function declaration
is called parameters.

Arguments:- The values which we will write during function calling is 
called arguments.

Return Value:- It will return some value or it will return something 

int main()  --int--return type 
{
	return 0;  -- return value

}

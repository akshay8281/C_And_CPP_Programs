Recursion Function:-


Recursion is a special type of function which defined as a function 
which calls itself is called Recursive Function and this process
is called Recursion.

Note:-

1) It works only for Function with parameters.
2) It works based on given condition.

syntax:-

	datatype funname()
	{
		condition;
		block of code;
		funname();


	}
	main()
	{
		funname();

	}






5!=5*4*3*2*1




Pointers:- Pointers is used to find the address of a variable

%p--pointer

%x--Hexadecimal form

&a-- address of a



It is used to locate the variables and it will give the output in hexadecimal form




*p,*q,*r

Structure:-

multiple values in a single element.

Interview Question:-
Difference Between Array and Structure:-

---> Array can store multiple values of one datatype but structure can store
multiple values of different data types.

syntax:-


	struct structurename
	{
		datatype1 var1,var2,var3;
		datatype2 var4,var5;

	};
	main()
	{
		struct structurename varname;

	}


---> Total size of stucture is 28 bytes.

Union:-

Difference Between structure and union:-

Total size of structure is 28 bytes.

Particular datatype is 20 bytes.
